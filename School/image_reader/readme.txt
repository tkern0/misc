So the task here was to make a program (with gui) that can read metadata off of
 images and write it to a .csv file. So fo this you obviously want to use PIL.
 The problem was we also weren't allowed to install other modules, because the
 head of IT is paranoid and really doesn't know how to do anything beyond
 password resets. So because of this I started out trying to manually implement
 PIL's EXIF data reading. But that was a terrible solution so I switched to just
 coding bind, and only being able to test at home.

Another requirement of the task was to show how the program developed. The task
 sheet literally said "upload your work to github", but guess what? It was
 blocked. So because of that I have 9 seperate files showing how the program
 developed.

The program works, and fits the requirements, but due to time constraints I
 didn't get all the features I wanted in. A lot of these were actually due to
 the requirements, for example if I didn't need to show every image I could have
 pretty easily added bulk analysis. I could have tried to continue improving it
 afterwards, but I got burnt out and there are probably better programs already
 anyway.
